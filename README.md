# Network Connectivity Demo

## Description:
This is an illustrative project designed to evaluate and validate network connectivity.

  - This sample project encompasses three primary network connectivity scenarios:
    - Connected
    - Connected but lacking internet access
    - Disconnected

Additionally, it offers information about the source of the internet connection, including options like Wi-Fi, Ethernet, mobile data, and more.

  - Furthermore, this sample project incorporates a set of connectivity-related functions:
    - `initConnectivity()`
    - `onConnectivityChangedListener()`
    - `disposeListener()`
    - `updateConnectionStatus()`
    - `onConnectionChangeSnackBar()`
    - `connectivityBuilder()`
    - `hasNetwork()`

Important: In this example project, it performs ping tests on a selection of internet addresses to confirm the state of connectivity. Utilizing an integrated data connection checker, it initiates pings to dependable servers such as CloudFlare, Google, and OpenDNS.
